# CurriculumVitae-Website
2020 - Currently Developing

A website that represents my curriculum.

### The idea

I always wanted to know React, so I thought about creating a website to learn what React is and this idea came to mind.
I wanted to better my CV so why not making actually a website of my CV.

### The Development

I started by designing how the website should look like on Inkscape, dividing it into small parts. Then i started developing.
First thing i did was create a Header with a DropDownMenu to log-in. Then, on the other side of the page, i created a Mini-Drawer, to display Menu Items, such as: 'About Me', 'Skills', 'Educational History', 'Portfolio', 'Hobbies' and 'Contact Information'. Then i worked on Routing to make those Meny Items actually take who clicks them somewhere. All that was left was filling each page with content and Voil√°. Job Done.

### Tech && Methodologies
JavaScript, React, Inkscape;
