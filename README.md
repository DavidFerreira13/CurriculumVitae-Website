# CurriculumVitae-Website
2020 - Currently Developing

A solo project to display my ability as a web designer

### The idea

I wanted to better my CV so the idea came straight to my mind about making a website to actually display my CV.

### The Development

Since i didn't really know react at all, but wanted to learn, i bought a course online on Udemy to teach me how react works.
I started by designing how the website should look like on Inkscape, dividing it by small parts. Then i started developing.
First thing i did was create a Header with a DropDownMenu to log-in. Then, on the other side of the page, i created a Mini-Drawer, to display Menu Items, such as: 'About Me', 'Skills', 'Educational History', 'Portfolio', 'Hobbies' and 'Contact Information'.

### Tech && Methodologies
JavaScript, React, Inkscape;
